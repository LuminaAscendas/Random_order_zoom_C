    	'Human development threatens some protected areas—for example, the harvest of natural resources for human use.',
		'Human knowledge of ecosystems is limited, and more scientific data are needed to make good management decisions.',
		'Conservation management must be adaptive (flexible to meet new problems) rather than adhere to old procedures because "that’s what has always been done."',
		'Humans are an important part of nature. Human values, needs, and desires must be considered when making management decisions.',
		'Protected areas are often so fragmented that, when a local population declines in number, natural migration to rebuild the population can’t occur.',
		'Protected areas are often too small to support certain populations and ecological processes in the long term.',
		'Human-affected environments often surround protected areas, threatening them with invasive species, pollution, and other problems.'
